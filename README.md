# F21SC Industrial Programming C# Individual Coursework

This application accepts URLs input by users and returns the raw HTML of the page, effectively acting as a basic web browser. Users can search for multiple pages and then traverse back and forth through the history of their searches. Users can also delete their history and save certain web pages as favourites, view these favourites and return to those pages from the favourites without needing to submit the URL in the search bar again.

The application makes use of the Model View Controller and Observer design patterns.

The application can be run by running the F21SC_CW1_WebBrowser.exe in the “Application” folder.
