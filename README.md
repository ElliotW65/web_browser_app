This application accepts URLs input by users and returns the raw HTML of the page, effectively acting as a basic web browser. Users can search for multiple pages and then traverse back and forth through the history of their searches. Users can also delete their history and save certain web pages as favourites, view these favourites and return to those pages from the favourites without needing to submit the URL in the search bar again.

The application makes use of the Model View Controller and Observer design patterns.

A demo of the application can be viewed by downloading the mp4 video “F21SC_CW1_Application Demo.mp4” and a full technical report of the application can be found in “F21SC_CW1_Report.pdf”.

The application can be run by running the F21SC_CW1_WebBrowser.exe in the “Application” folder.
